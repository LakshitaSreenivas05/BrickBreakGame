# BrickBreakGame
Brick Breaker is a classic arcade-style game. The objective is simple: break all the bricks on the screen using a bouncing ball, while controlling a paddle that moves left and right at the bottom of the screen. As the ball bounces off the paddle and hits the bricks, the bricks break apart, disappearing one by one.
